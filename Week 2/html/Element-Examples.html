    <!-- 
        Use Header elements when you want to create some kind of heading
        for a section of your web page
    -->
    <h1>This is a header</h1>

    <!-- 
        Use img elements when you want to render images on your page. The src attribute is used
        to provide the browser with the URL for the image (can be web based or local path). alt
        can be used to display text if the src URL is broken (bad web request, new local path, etc.)
    -->
    <img src="example-image.png" alt="won't display">
    <img src="examplee-image.png" alt="displayed if src url is broken">

    <!-- 
        Use the p element when you have a paragraph of text you want to display
    -->
    <p>Paragraph elements can be used to hold text</p>

    <!-- 
        There are two types of lists you can generate with base HTML: ordered and unordered
        lists. Here is our first example of how parent elements can change the way their child
        elements are rendered. Ordered List elements make their child list items numbered, whereas
        Unordered Lists make it so their list items are unnumbered. The attributes of parent
        elements will oftentimes affect the attributes of the child elements
    -->
    <ol>
        <!-- 
            In this ordered list ol is the parent, the li elements are the children of ol,
            and the li elements are siblings of one another
        -->
        <li>Item One</li>
        <li>Item Two</li>
        <li>Item Three</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <!-- 
            In this unordered list ul is the parent, the li elements are the children of ul,
            and the li elements are siblings of one another
        -->
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Orange</li>
        <li>Pear</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- 
        In the two lists above, all the list items are descendants of the body element
    -->
