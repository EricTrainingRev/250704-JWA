## Intro to HTML

### Overview of HTML
**Hypertext Markup Language** **HTML**, is the standard language used to create web pages. It defines the structure and layout of a web page using a series of elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. When combined with other languages like JavaScript and **CSS**, **HTML** helps create dynamic and interactive web pages. Web browsers have interpreters that convert **HTML** into content displayed on the screen. This markup language is quite forgiving, as browsers will attempt to fix any broken **HTML** to ensure it can still be interpreted. Webpages are structured using large blocks called **elements**, which consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. These **elements** are manged through the use of the **Document Object Model (DOM)**

### HTML & the DOM
The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a representation of an **HTML** document in memory. It is generated by the browser when a web page is rendered and can be manipulated by Web APIs to interact with the page as it is being viewed. The **DOM** acts as an interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document. While JavaScript is commonly used to manipulate the **DOM**, any language that can interact with Web APIs can be used

## HTML Foundation

### HTML Tags
**HTML** **tags** denote the start and end of an **element**. For example, to define a paragraph in **HTML**, you would write `<p></p>` in the **HTML** file. This line begins and ends with the same syntax, with the difference being the `/` added to the closing **tag**. The `/` tells the interpreter that the **element** is finished, so any **tag** with a `/` in front is referred to as a `closing tag`. The terms **tag** and **element** are often used interchangeably, which can be confusing. The **tag** determines the functionality and structure, while the entire block from start to finish is referred to as the **element**. For example, in the HTML **element** `<p>Hello World</p>`, `<p>` is the **opening tag**, "Hello World" is the enclosed text content, and `</p>` is the **closing tag**. The entire structure is called the **element**, but the look and feel are determined by the **tags** used

### Elements & Attributes
**Attributes** in **HTML** are key-value pairs used to set various properties of an element, and they are always included in the **opening tag**. These **attributes** serve different purposes, such as identification and functionality. For identification, **attributes** like `id` and `class` are commonly used. The `id` **attribute** assigns a unique identifier to an **element**, allowing it to be easily targeted by **CSS** or JavaScript. The `class` **attribute**, on the other hand, can be used to group multiple **elements** together, making it easier to apply styles or behaviors to them collectively. Functionality-related attributes include `href` for links, `src` for images, and `alt` for alternative text for images. The `href` **attribute** specifies the URL of the page the link goes to, while the `src` **attribute** defines the source of an image. The `alt` **attribute** provides alternative text for an image, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded, and is also used by screen readers for accessibility. Other **attributes** can control the behavior of **elements**, such as `disabled` for form inputs, `checked` for checkboxes, and `readonly` for text fields

### Inline & Block Elements
**HTML elements** can be categorized into two main types: **inline and block elements**. Each type has unique characteristics that affect how they are displayed on a webpage. For example, the `<p>` and `<span>` elements illustrate these differences

A **block element**, like `<p>`, will stretch to take up the entire width of its container. It always begins on a new line and is followed by a new line. Examples of **block elements** include headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), divisions (`<div>`), ordered and unordered lists and their items (`<ol>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`), tables (`<table>`), and sections (`<section>`)

In contrast, an **inline element**, like `<span>`, will only take up as much space as its content requires. **Inline elements** do not start on a new line and can appear beside other **inline elements**. Examples of **inline elements** include links (`<a>`), spans (`<span>`), inputs (`<input>`), labels (`<label>`), and citations (`<cite>`)

### Common Tags
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph of text
- `<button>`: Creates a clickable button
- `<input>`: Represents an input field where users can enter data
- `<table>`: Defines a table for organizing data in rows and columns
- `<a>`: Creates a hyperlink to another webpage or resource
- `<img>`: Embeds an image into the webpage
- `<select>`: Creates a drop-down list for selecting options
- `<div>`: Defines a division or section in an HTML document, often used for layout purposes
- `<span>`: Used to group inline elements for styling purposes without affecting the layout

## HTML Forms

### Form Elements & Attributes
**Forms** in **HTML** used to be essential for collecting user input and making web request; they are defined using the `<form>` tags. Commonly used **elements** within **forms** include `<input>` for various types of data entry (text, password, email, etc.), `<textarea>` for multi-line text input, `<select>` for drop-down lists, `<button>` for clickable actions, and `<label>` to provide descriptions for input fields

Unique **attributes** in **forms** help manage data and enhance functionality. The `action` **attribute** specifies the URL where the **form** data should be sent, while the `method` **attribute** defines the HTTP method (GET or POST) used to submit the **form**. The `name` **attribute** assigns a name to the **form** **element**, which is used to identify the data when it is submitted. These **attributes** alo can be used alongside others like `placeholder`, `required`, and `autocomplete`

### Input Elements & Input Types
**HTML** **inputs** allow users to provide various types of data to a webpage. The `type` **attribute** determines the kind of input that is allowed. For example, the "text" type allows text input, the "number" type allows numeric input, the "range" type provides a slider to select a value between a specified minimum and maximum, and the "file" type lets users upload files. Additionally, multiple **attributes** can be used in conjunction with the specified **input** type to further define what can and cannot be provided. For instance, the `min` and `max` **attributes** set the minimum and maximum values for the **input**, the `pattern` **attribute** specifies a regular expression that the **input** must match to be considered valid, and the `accept` **attribute** determines which file types are acceptable for upload

### Select & Multiselect
The **select** **element** in **HTML** allows users to choose one or more values from a pre-determined list. By default, this **element** is presented as a dropdown list, but it can be customized. For instance, the `multiple` **attribute** enables users to select more than one option, and **optgroups** can be used to organize **options** into groups. Keep in mind the text displayed for an **option** and the actual value, determined by the `value` **attribute**, are separate resources and can be different

### Submitting Forms
**HTML** **forms** enable the submission of data through POST and GET requests. GET requests append any **form** data as query parameters in the URL, while POST requests include the **form** data in the request body, formatted similarly to query parameters. Depending on the results of the request, **form** submissions will either refresh the current page or load a new page. However, this default behavior can be prevented by using JavaScript

### HTML5 Validation
There are two forms of client-side validation in **HTML**: **HTML** validation and JavaScript validation. **HTML** validation is faster but less customizable. It includes attributes such as `required`, which indicates that a field must be provided, `type`, which specifies the kind of input, and `pattern`, which specifies the regular expression that the input must match, among others. On the other hand, JavaScript validation takes longer to set up but offers greater flexibility, allowing for custom validation to be programmed according to specific needs
