# Test Docs

## Test Plan
- A comprehensive document that covers how an application should be tested
- keep in mind the resources listed below can exist as their own documentation, or they can exist as part of the Test plan
    - Test Objectives
    - testing schedule
        - this can be its own resource
    - estimate details
        - how much will testing cost?
        - how much risk is involved?
    - deliverable expectations
        - test report expectations
        - test metrics expectations
        - build artifacts
- Ultimately, a test plan should be your central hub for checking testing requirements for the application you are working on

## Test Schedule
- this document holds the timeline for testing
    - deadlines
    - entry criteria & exit criteria
    - In an Agile environment, this is going to be a "living document"
        - "living document" == subject to change

## RTM
- This document used to be (and still can be if needed) an all-encompasing document. Requirements, User Stories, Test Cases, Test Result, all this and more used to be stored in the RTM. 
- it is a "traceability" document in that it was designed to allow for "tracing" or tracking work done on a requirement (think user story) throughout the entirety of a testing sprint
    - cloud and automated tools has made this unnecessary, but the RTM can always be used as a backup tool if things go wrong in the cloud
- this document is still a useful tool for initial organization of testing resources, particularly organizing user stories, requirements, acceptance criteria, and test data
