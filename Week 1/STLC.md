# Standard Testing Lifecycle
The STLC has 6 phases to it:
- Requirements Analysis****
    - During this phase you are recognizing and determining what your **test conditions** are based upon your **test basis**
        - test basis = the stuff that determines the testing you need to do
            - requirements documentation
            - conversations with stakeholders
            - previous testing documentation
            - etc.
        - test conditions = what you need to do for testing from a broad perspective
            - functional testing of application features
            - static testing of the design documents
    - to put it simply, during requirements analysis you analyze the stuff that tells you what needs to be tested in order to determine what needs to be tested
    - it is common to create (if one does not already exist) a **requirements traceability matrix** during this time
        - this is a document that is meant to help map requirements and features that are linked
        - it can also be used to map test data with features/requirements, link testers with specific features, etc.
        - rtms should work like a central source of "truth" concerning your testing: it will either have the information you need, or it should be able to point you in the right direction to get the info you need
        - often rtms will also map **user stories** with their **acceptance criteria**
            - user story = a phrase that describes a feature/capability of the application in a tech agnostic way
                - usually follow a similar design pattern for the:
                    - As a....
                        - user
                        - admin
                        - employee
                        - system
                    - I want....
                        - to log in
                        - to request pto
                        - to make a reimbursement request
                        - to add a friend to my friend list
                    - So that....
                        - I can access my account
                        - I can take a vacation
                        - I can get my money back
                        - I can stay connected with my friend
        - User stories are a collection of actor, action, and desired end result. Acceptance criteria lays out step by step how the actor performs the actions to reach the desired end result
            - example user story: As a user I want to log in so I can access my account
                - user goes to the login page
                    - describes the starting condition 
                - user enters their credentials and clicks the login button
                    - this one describes the action/s taken to complete the user story
                - user should be sent to the homepage of the application
                    - this one describes the end conditions of the user story
- Test Planning
- Test Case Design
- Test Environment Setup
- Test Execution
- Test Closure
